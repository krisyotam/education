## The Science of Learning

### Bloom's 2 Sigma Problem

In 1984, educational psychologist Benjamin Bloom published a landmark finding: students who received one-on-one tutoring with mastery learning performed **two standard deviations** above conventionally taught students — meaning the average tutored student outperformed 98% of the control group.

**Key numbers:**
- Conventional classroom: baseline
- Mastery learning (classroom): +1 sigma (84th percentile)
- Mastery learning + 1-on-1 tutoring: +2 sigma (98th percentile)

**Subsequent research** (Nickow, Oreopoulos & Quan, 2020 meta-analysis of 96 RCTs) found the average tutoring effect is closer to **d = 0.37** (14 percentile points), though some interventions reach d = 0.79. The original 2-sigma finding likely overestimated due to methodological issues, but the core insight holds: **personalized, mastery-based instruction dramatically outperforms passive classroom learning.**

The self-study implication: you can approximate 1-on-1 tutoring conditions yourself by combining mastery learning (don't move on until you've mastered prerequisites), immediate feedback (solutions manuals, auto-graders), and spaced retrieval.

### Cognitive Load Theory (Sweller)

Developed by John Sweller in the late 1980s. The core insight: working memory can only hold ~4 chunks of information simultaneously. Learning fails when cognitive load exceeds working memory capacity.

**Three types of cognitive load:**
1. **Intrinsic** — inherent difficulty of the material (can't reduce, but can scaffold)
2. **Extraneous** — caused by poor instruction design (eliminate this)
3. **Germane** — mental effort devoted to schema construction (maximize this)

**Practical implications:**
- Use **worked examples** early (the worked-example effect: studying worked solutions is more effective than solving equivalent problems for novices)
- Avoid split-attention: integrate text and diagrams
- Reduce redundancy: don't present the same information in multiple formats simultaneously
- **Expertise reversal effect**: as expertise grows, worked examples become less effective and problem-solving becomes more effective — adjust accordingly

**Source:** Sweller, J. (2011). *Cognitive Load Theory*. Springer.

### Desirable Difficulties (Bjork)

Robert Bjork's research shows that conditions making learning *feel* harder in the short term often produce stronger long-term retention. The brain distinguishes between:

- **Storage strength** — how deeply encoded information is (builds with effort)
- **Retrieval strength** — how easily accessible it is right now (high after cramming, fades fast)

**The key desirable difficulties:**
1. **Spacing** — distribute practice over time (vs. massing/cramming)
2. **Interleaving** — mix problem types during practice (vs. blocking)
3. **Retrieval practice** — test yourself instead of re-reading
4. **Varying conditions** — study in different contexts, with different examples
5. **Generation** — attempt to produce answers before being shown them

**Warning:** These are only "desirable" when the learner can still succeed. If they lead to failure and frustration, they become *undesirable* difficulties. Calibrate to your level.

**Source:** Bjork, R. A., & Bjork, E. L. (2011). "Making things hard on yourself, but in a good way." In *Psychology and the real world* (pp. 56-64).

### Focused vs. Diffuse Thinking (Oakley)

Barbara Oakley's framework (drawn from neuroscience):

- **Focused mode**: Prefrontal cortex engaged, tight concentration on familiar patterns. Good for sequential, analytical work.
- **Diffuse mode**: Relaxed, background processing across wider neural networks. Good for making new connections, creative insights, getting "unstuck."

**Practical protocol:** Alternate between focused work sessions and breaks. The Pomodoro Technique (25 min focus + 5 min break) operationalizes this. When stuck, deliberately switch to diffuse mode (walk, shower, nap) and return.

**Chunking:** The process of binding scattered information into compact meaningful units. Working memory holds ~4 chunks. The more you chunk, the more complex ideas you can manipulate. Expertise = having large, well-organized chunks.

## Evidence-Based Study Techniques

### Tier 1: Highest Evidence (Large Effect Sizes)

| Technique | Description | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| **Retrieval Practice** | Test yourself instead of re-reading. Flashcards, practice problems, free recall, practice exams. | Roediger & Karpicke (2006): testing effect produces 50-80% better long-term retention vs. re-study |
| **Spaced Practice** | Distribute study over multiple sessions with gaps. | Cepeda et al. (2006) meta-analysis: spacing effect is one of the most robust findings in cognitive psychology |
| **Interleaving** | Mix different problem types or topics during practice. | Rohrer & Taylor (2007): interleaving produced 43% higher test scores than blocking |
| **Elaborative Interrogation** | Ask "why?" and "how?" while studying. Explain mechanisms. | Dunlosky et al. (2013): rated "moderate" to "high" utility across review of 10 techniques |

### Tier 2: Strong Evidence

| Technique | Description | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| **The Feynman Technique** | 1) Choose concept. 2) Explain it as if teaching a child. 3) Identify gaps. 4) Simplify and use analogies. | Based on Feynman's practice; aligns with generation effect and elaboration research |
| **Dual Coding** | Combine verbal and visual representations (diagrams + text). | Paivio's dual coding theory; Clark & Paivio (1991) |
| **Concrete Examples** | Illustrate abstract concepts with specific cases. | Rawson et al. (2015) |
| **Self-Explanation** | Explain to yourself why each step in a solution works. | Chi et al. (1989): self-explainers outperformed non-self-explainers by 1 SD |

### Tier 3: What Doesn't Work (Despite Popularity)

| Technique | Problem |
|---|---|
| **Re-reading** | Creates illusion of fluency without actual learning. Dunlosky et al. (2013): "low utility" |
| **Highlighting/underlining** | Passive, doesn't engage retrieval or elaboration. "Low utility" |
| **Summarizing** | Can work if done well, but most students do it poorly. "Low utility" for most learners |
| **Cramming** | Produces short-term retrieval strength but minimal long-term storage |

## Spaced Repetition

### The Science

Spaced repetition exploits the **spacing effect** (Ebbinghaus, 1885) and the **testing effect** to schedule reviews at optimal intervals — just before you would forget.

**Key findings:**
- Students using Anki scored 6-13% higher on standardized medical exams vs. traditional study (PMC, 2023)
- Spaced repetition can increase long-term retention by 200-300% vs. massed practice
- A simple schedule: Day 1 → Day 2 → Day 5 → Day 10 → Day 20 → Day 40 achieves near-permanent retention in only 5 reviews

### Anki: The Tool

**Anki** (https://apps.ankiweb.net/) is the gold standard spaced repetition software, using a modified SM-2 algorithm.

**Best practices for card creation:**
- **Minimum information principle**: one fact per card
- **Cloze deletions** for definitions and theorems
- **Image occlusion** for anatomy, diagrams, maps
- **Avoid "orphan" cards**: always understand context before making cards
- **20 rules of formulating knowledge** by Piotr Wozniak: https://supermemo.com/en/blog/twenty-rules-of-formulating-knowledge

**When to use spaced repetition:**
- Declarative knowledge: facts, definitions, theorems, vocabulary, dates, formulas
- NOT for procedural skills (do problem sets instead) or deep theory (read and reflect instead)

**Pre-made decks to consider:**
- AnKing (medical school)
- Math decks on AnkiWeb
- Language decks (Core 2000 Japanese, frequency-based vocab lists)
- Custom decks from your own reading are always more effective than pre-made

### Alternatives to Anki
- **SuperMemo** — the original SRS (Wozniak), more complex but theoretically optimal
- **Mnemosyne** — open source alternative
- **RemNote** — combines note-taking and SRS
- **Orbit** — by Andy Matuschak, embedded SRS in reading

## Accelerated Learning Frameworks

### Ultralearning (Scott Young)

Nine principles from *Ultralearning* (2019):

1. **Metalearning** — Spend ~10% of project time researching *how* to learn the subject (what to learn, in what order, with what resources). Map the knowledge structure.
2. **Focus** — Develop ability to sustain deep concentration. Start with shorter sessions, build up. Eliminate distractions ruthlessly.
3. **Directness** — Learn by doing the thing itself, not a proxy. Want to code? Code. Want to speak French? Speak French. Transfer from passive study to real application is poor.
4. **Drill** — Identify bottleneck sub-skills and isolate them for intensive practice. The "rate-determining step" of your learning.
5. **Retrieval** — Test yourself relentlessly. Don't look things up until you've tried to recall.
6. **Feedback** — Seek fast, informative feedback. Distinguish: outcome feedback (right/wrong) < informational feedback (what specifically went wrong) < corrective feedback (how to fix it).
7. **Retention** — Use spacing, proceduralization, and overlearning to fight forgetting.
8. **Intuition** — Build deep understanding through worked examples, Feynman technique, asking "why" repeatedly. Don't memorize what you can derive.
9. **Experimentation** — As you advance, explore your own approaches. True mastery involves going beyond existing methods.

### Tim Ferriss's DiSSS Framework

From *The 4-Hour Chef* (2012):

1. **Deconstruction** — Break the skill into minimal learnable units. What are the Lego blocks?
2. **Selection** — Apply 80/20: which 20% of the blocks will give you 80% of the results? Focus there.
3. **Sequencing** — What order should you learn them in? Often counterintuitive. (e.g., start with grammar in languages, not vocabulary)
4. **Stakes** — Create real consequences for not learning (accountability, public commitment, money on the line).

### Josh Waitzkin's Learning Principles

From *The Art of Learning* (2008). Waitzkin was a chess prodigy (basis for *Searching for Bobby Fischer*) who became a World Champion in Tai Chi Push Hands.

**Key principles:**
- **Numbers to leave numbers**: Master fundamentals so deeply they become intuitive. Start with endgame (chess), not openings.
- **Making smaller circles**: Take a technique and practice it in increasingly subtle, refined ways. Compress complexity into simplicity.
- **Building your trigger**: Develop a pre-performance routine that reliably puts you in your optimal mental state.
- **Investment in loss**: Embrace short-term failure for long-term growth. Give up positions of comfort to find deeper skill.
- **The downward spiral vs. the soft zone**: Don't let mistakes cascade. Stay present. Use adversity as fuel.

### The Feynman Technique (Detailed)

Named for Richard Feynman, Nobel laureate physicist, legendary explainer:

1. **Choose a concept** you want to understand.
2. **Explain it in writing** as if teaching someone with no background. Use simple language.
3. **Identify gaps** — wherever you get stuck or resort to jargon, you don't really understand it.
4. **Go back to the source material** and fill the gaps.
5. **Simplify and use analogies.** The goal is a clear, simple explanation that a child could follow.

The key insight: the act of explaining forces you to organize knowledge, identify missing links, and build genuine understanding (not just recognition).

- **Source**: https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2023/02/21/diego-vera-mit-challenge-math-physics/ and https://www.diegovera.org/projects

### Benny Lewis — Language Learning (3-month missions)

- **What**: Learns languages to conversational fluency in 3 months
- **Method**: Immersion-first, speaking from day 1, flashcards for vocabulary, grammar study on the side
- **Timeline**: 3 months per language to B1-B2 level (conversational)
- **Key insight**: Directness principle — actual conversation from the start beats years of textbook study
- **Source**: https://www.fluentin3months.com/

### Eric Barone (ConcernedApe) — Game Development (Self-Taught, ~5 years)

- **What**: Single-handedly developed *Stardew Valley* — art, music, programming, design, writing
- **Timeline**: ~4.5 years of development
- **Method**: Self-taught all skills (C#, pixel art, music composition) while working
- **Key insight**: You can reach professional/commercial quality in multiple creative skills simultaneously, but it takes years of daily work

### George Green — Mathematics (Self-Taught, 19th Century)

- **What**: Self-taught mathematician who developed Green's theorem, Green's functions
- **Timeline**: Largely self-educated with access to only a few books
- **Key insight**: Depth of thinking matters more than breadth of resources. He had almost nothing and produced foundational mathematics.

### Srinivasa Ramanujan — Mathematics (Self-Taught)

- **What**: Developed thousands of mathematical theorems with almost no formal training
- **Source material**: Largely worked from a single book — Carr's *Synopsis of Elementary Results in Pure Mathematics*
- **Key insight**: Extraordinary talent can compensate for lack of formal structure, but even Ramanujan eventually sought collaboration (Hardy) to refine and verify his work

### Approximate Timelines for Self-Study to Various Levels

Based on aggregated case studies and research:

| Field | To Undergrad Equivalent | To Graduate/Masters Equivalent | To PhD-Level Research Competence |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Computer Science** | 1-2 years (1,500-3,000 hrs) | 2-4 years (3,000-6,000 hrs) | 4-7 years (6,000-10,000 hrs) |
| **Mathematics** | 2-3 years (2,000-4,000 hrs) | 3-5 years (4,000-7,000 hrs) | 5-8 years (7,000-12,000 hrs) |
| **Physics** | 2-3 years (2,000-4,000 hrs) | 3-5 years (4,000-7,000 hrs) | 5-8 years (7,000-12,000 hrs) |
| **Languages** (to C1) | 0.5-2 years (600-2,200 hrs, FSI data) | N/A | N/A |
| **Music** (to professional) | 3-5 years | 5-8 years | 8-15 years (competition/conservatory level) |
| **Writing** | 2-4 years | 4-7 years | Highly variable |

**Caveats**: These are rough estimates for a dedicated self-studier working 3-6 hours/day. Individual variation is enormous. Prior knowledge, learning ability, quality of resources, and feedback loops all matter.

## Expertise Research

### The 10,000 Hour Rule — What the Research Actually Says

**Original research:** Ericsson, Krampe & Tesch-Romer (1993) studied violin students at a Berlin music academy. The top performers had accumulated ~10,000 hours of *deliberate practice* by age 20.

**What Gladwell popularized (and distorted):**
- Malcolm Gladwell's *Outliers* (2008) turned this into a universal "10,000 hour rule"
- Ericsson himself called this "a provocative generalization"

**What subsequent research found:**
- Macnamara et al. (2014) meta-analysis: deliberate practice explains only:
  - 26% of variance in games (chess, Go)
  - 21% in music
  - 18% in sports
  - 4% in education
  - 1% in professions
- Other factors: genetics, starting age, quality of practice, quality of instruction, intelligence, personality

**The corrected picture:**
- There is no fixed hour threshold for expertise
- **Deliberate practice** (not just any practice) is what matters — focused effort on weaknesses with feedback
- Some domains have faster mastery curves than others
- Individual differences are huge — some people reach world-class in 3,000 hours, others never do in 20,000
- 10,000 hours is a *rough average* for competitive domains (chess, music, sports), not a law

**Source:** Ericsson, K. A. (2016). *Peak: Secrets from the New Science of Expertise*. Mariner Books.

### Deliberate Practice: What It Actually Means

Ericsson's criteria for deliberate practice:
1. **Designed to improve performance** — has a specific goal
2. **Requires focused effort** — not autopilot, not "flow"
3. **Involves feedback** — immediate, informative
4. **Involves repetition with refinement** — not just repetition
5. **Is often not enjoyable** — pushes you at the edge of your ability

**Contrast with:**
- **Naive practice**: Mindless repetition (playing songs you already know)
- **Purposeful practice**: Has goals but lacks expert-designed structure
- **Deliberate practice**: Has goals, expert design, and immediate feedback

### The Learning Curve

Expertise acquisition typically follows an S-curve:
1. **Rapid early gains** — low-hanging fruit, basics are rewarding
2. **Extended middle plateau** — the "grind," where most people quit
3. **Slow approach to mastery** — diminishing returns, increasingly subtle improvements

**The OK Plateau**: Once performance reaches "good enough," most people stop improving. Breaking through requires deliberate effort on weaknesses — which is uncomfortable.

## Learning by Knowledge Type

### Declarative Knowledge (Facts, Concepts, Definitions)

**Best methods:**
- **Spaced repetition** (Anki) — the single best tool for declarative retention
- **Elaborative interrogation** — ask "why is this true?"
- **Concept mapping** — connect ideas visually
- **Dual coding** — pair verbal descriptions with diagrams

**Assessment:** Can you recall it from memory? Can you explain it to someone else?

### Procedural Knowledge (Skills, Problem-Solving, Doing)

**Best methods:**
- **Deliberate practice** — focused work on specific weaknesses with feedback
- **Worked examples → Problem-solving** transition (as per cognitive load theory)
- **Interleaving** — mix problem types
- **Drill** — isolate sub-skills (Ultralearning principle)
- **Progressive overload** — steadily increase difficulty
- **Directness** — practice the actual skill, not a proxy

**Assessment:** Can you solve novel problems? Can you perform under pressure?

### Theoretical Understanding (Deep Comprehension, Intuition)

**Best methods:**
- **Feynman technique** — explain in simple terms, find gaps
- **Reading primary sources** — engage with original arguments, not summaries
- **Discussion and debate** — test your understanding against others
- **Writing** — articulate your understanding in essays, summaries, or blog posts
- **Teaching** — the best test of understanding
- **Multiple representations** — understand the same idea from different angles

**Assessment:** Can you explain it without jargon? Can you apply it to novel situations? Can you connect it to other ideas? Can you derive results rather than just recite them?

## Practical Protocols

### Protocol 1: Starting a New Subject (First 2 Weeks)

1. **Metalearning phase** (Days 1-3): Research the subject structure. Find 3-5 recommended syllabi (university courses). Identify the canonical textbooks. Map prerequisites. Decide on your "final exam" — what will you be able to do when you're done?
2. **Survey phase** (Days 4-7): Skim the entire textbook or course notes. Read the Wikipedia overview. Watch a high-level overview lecture. Get the big picture before diving into details.
3. **Begin active study** (Days 8-14): Start working through the first unit. Read the chapter, then close the book and try to recall the key ideas. Do the first problem set. Make your first Anki cards for key definitions and theorems.

### Protocol 2: Daily Study Session (3-5 hours)

1. **Anki review** (20-30 min) — Clear your daily reviews first. Non-negotiable.
2. **Focused study block 1** (50-90 min) — Read new material or watch lecture. Take notes using Cornell method or Zettelkasten.
3. **Break** (10-15 min) — Walk, stretch, diffuse thinking.
4. **Problem-solving block** (50-90 min) — Work through exercises. Attempt before checking solutions. Use the Feynman technique when stuck.
5. **Break** (10-15 min)
6. **Focused study block 2** (50-90 min) — Continue problems or read the next section.
7. **Review & Anki card creation** (15-20 min) — Make cards for new definitions/theorems learned today. Review what you struggled with.

### Protocol 3: Weekly Review

Every Sunday (or your chosen day):
1. **Free recall** — Without notes, write down everything you learned this week. Identify gaps.
2. **Review problem set performance** — Which problems did you struggle with? Why? What sub-skills need drilling?
3. **Adjust the plan** — Are you on pace? Do you need to spend more time on fundamentals before moving on?
4. **Interleave** — Do a mixed problem set covering material from the past 2-4 weeks.

### Protocol 4: Mastery Check Before Moving On

Before advancing to the next major topic:
- Can you solve 80%+ of the textbook exercises without hints?
- Can you explain the key concepts to an imaginary student (Feynman test)?
- Can you pass a practice exam (university midterm/final from OCW)?
- Can you connect this topic to previously learned material?

If yes → move on. If no → drill the weak spots first.

### Protocol 5: The Ultralearning Project Template

1. **Define the project**: What skill or body of knowledge? What's the deadline? What does "done" look like?
2. **Metalearning** (10% of total time): Research how others learned it. Find the best resources. Map the curriculum.
3. **Set up the environment**: Block distractions. Schedule daily time blocks. Set up Anki. Get the textbooks.
4. **Execute daily**: Follow Protocol 2. Track hours. Weekly review (Protocol 3).
5. **Benchmark monthly**: Take a practice exam or complete a project milestone. Compare to expectations. Adjust.
6. **Final assessment**: Pass your "final exam." Can you do what you set out to do?
